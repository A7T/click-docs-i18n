msgid "What problem does virtualenv solve?  Chances are that you want to use it for other projects besides your Click script.  But the more projects you have, the more likely it is that you will be working with different versions of Python itself, or at least different versions of Python libraries.  Let's face it: quite often libraries break backwards compatibility, and it's unlikely that any serious application will have zero dependencies.  So what do you do if two or more of your projects have conflicting dependencies?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:29
msgid "Virtualenv to the rescue!  Virtualenv enables multiple side-by-side installations of Python, one for each project.  It doesn't actually install separate copies of Python, but it does provide a clever way to keep different project environments isolated.  Let's see how virtualenv works."

msgid "Click is based on declaring commands through decorators.  Internally, there is a non-decorator interface for advanced use cases, but it's discouraged for high-level usage."
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:125
msgid "A function becomes a Click command line tool by decorating it through :func:`click.command`.  At its simplest, just decorating a function with this decorator will make it into a callable script:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:137
msgid "What's happening is that the decorator converts the function into a :class:`Command` which then can be invoked::"

msgid "Echoing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:158
msgid "Why does this example use :func:`echo` instead of the regular :func:`print` function?  The answer to this question is that Click attempts to support different environments consistently and to be very robust even when the environment is misconfigured.  Click wants to be functional at least on a basic level even if everything is completely broken."
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:165
msgid "What this means is that the :func:`echo` function applies some error correction in case the terminal is misconfigured instead of dying with an :exc:`UnicodeError`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:169
msgid "The echo function also supports color and other styles in output. It will automatically remove styles if the output stream is a file. On Windows, colorama is automatically installed and used. See :ref:`ansi-colors`."

msgid "Nesting Commands"

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:180
msgid "Commands can be attached to other commands of type :class:`Group`.  This allows arbitrary nesting of scripts.  As an example here is a script that implements two commands for managing databases:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:201
msgid "As you can see, the :func:`group` decorator works like the :func:`command` decorator, but creates a :class:`Group` object instead which can be given multiple subcommands that can be attached with :meth:`Group.add_command`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:205
msgid "For simple scripts, it's also possible to automatically attach and create a command by using the :meth:`Group.command` decorator instead.  The above script can instead be written like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:223
msgid "You would then invoke the :class:`Group` in your setuptools entry points or other invocations::"

msgid "Registering Commands Later"
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:233
msgid "Instead of using the ``@group.command()`` decorator, commands can be decorated with the plain ``@click.command()`` decorator and registered with a group later with ``group.add_command()``. This could be used to split commands into multiple Python modules."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding Parameters"
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:256
msgid "To add parameters, use the :func:`option` and :func:`argument` decorators:"

msgid "What it looks like:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:276
msgid "Switching to Setuptools"
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:278
msgid "In the code you wrote so far there is a block at the end of the file which looks like this: ``if __name__ == '__main__':``.  This is traditionally how a standalone Python file looks like.  With Click you can continue doing that, but there are better ways through setuptools."
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:283
msgid "There are two main (and many more) reasons for this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:285
msgid "The first one is that setuptools automatically generates executable wrappers for Windows so your command line utilities work on Windows too."
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:288
msgid "The second reason is that setuptools scripts work with virtualenv on Unix without the virtualenv having to be activated.  This is a very useful concept which allows you to bundle your scripts with all requirements into a virtualenv."
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:293
msgid "Click is perfectly equipped to work with that and in fact the rest of the documentation will assume that you are writing applications through setuptools."
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/quickstart.rst:297
msgid "I strongly recommend to have a look at the :ref:`setuptools-integration` chapter before reading the rest as the examples assume that you will be using setuptools."
