msgid "One of the problems with the traditional approach is that the first module the Python interpreter loads has an incorrect name.  This might sound like a small issue but it has quite significant implications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/setuptools.rst:16
msgid "The first module is not called by its actual name, but the interpreter renames it to ``__main__``.  While that is a perfectly valid name it means that if another piece of code wants to import from that module it will trigger the import a second time under its real name and all of a sudden your code is imported twice."

#: ../../click/docs/setuptools.rst:22
msgid "Not on all platforms are things that easy to execute.  On Linux and OS X you can add a comment to the beginning of the file (``#!/usr/bin/env python``) and your script works like an executable (assuming it has the executable bit set).  This however does not work on Windows. While on Windows you can associate interpreters with file extensions (like having everything ending in ``.py`` execute through the Python interpreter) you will then run into issues if you want to use the script in a virtualenv."
msgstr ""

#: ../../click/docs/setuptools.rst:31
msgid "In fact running a script in a virtualenv is an issue with OS X and Linux as well.  With the traditional approach you need to have the whole virtualenv activated so that the correct Python interpreter is used.  Not very user friendly."

The first part before the equals sign (``=``) is the name of the script that should be generated, the second part is the import path followed by a colon (``:``) with the Click command."
